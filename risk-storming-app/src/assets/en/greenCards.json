    "exampleOne": "Create your own list of personal requirements. Compare your list with the client's list. What can the both of you learn from them? ",
    "exampleTwo": "Requirements or use case lists are never finite. Can you come up with \"misuse\" cases? ",
    "exampleThree": "If you jump into legacy applications, quite often there are no requirements. Your test results are desperately needed because no one knows what the app actually does and what it should do."

    "exampleOne": "Does a feature feel intuitive? Do you know which buttons to click? Do you have to do more actions than originally expected? ",
    "exampleTwo": "Explore an app without any previous knowledge of it. Can you deduce what the app wants to achieve? ",
    "exampleThree": "Start listing all the features you can find in an unknown module or app. Then check with an expert to see which ones you missed. Would a user miss these features too?"

    "subTitle": "Techniques",
    "description": "Personal level: Important information is often found in the documents left behind by your project. ",
    "exampleOne": "Old documents or wiki pages can hold interesting, possibly forgotten information. A tester is usually the expert who knows what the state of the product is in at any given moment. ",
    "exampleTwo": "Identify knowledge that only one or two persons on the project have. Spread it.",
    "exampleThree": "Consider doing a daily \"did you know this about our app?\". This could bring knowledge of useful features, funny bugs, weird behaviour and powerful demonstrations to the team."

    "subTitle": "Techniques",
    "description": "Product level: Inspecting, cleaning, transforming, and modelling data with the goal of discovering useful information. ",
    "exampleOne": "Legacy data is often very fragile. Gaps, bad data or displacement could riddle the database. Usually a few good queries can quickly find whether your data is valuable or not. ",
    "exampleTwo": "Consider improving the visualisation of your  data if it's too hard or too extensive to go through. Add colour, zoom out and look for patterns. Data input and output are both immensely important. ",
    "exampleThree": "Pay attention to how your input gets changed, saved and returned. How do you store data elements ?"

    "exampleOne": "Instead of quickly going through the important scenario of adding an item to a cart and paying, change your behaviour a bit. Add some more items, then remove them while changing your credit cards and address. ",
    "exampleTwo": "Test Case Scenario's often go from point A to B in as few  actions possible. Users don't usually behave that way. They do unexpected things.",

    "exampleTwo": "For a new feature, make two or more mock-ups with different concepts. Then use the one your users react the best towards. ",
    "exampleThree": "Present two possible strategies to achieve a test mission. Discuss with the team and your stakeholders to choose the one that's within their best interest."

    "exampleOne": "A programmer who's on your side is a good friend to have. One that drops anything to unblock you, run a query for test data or results. Cherish those teammates. ",
    "exampleTwo": "Stakeholders who lean on you to get important things done will not only guide you, but also support and follow you in return. ",
    "exampleThree": "It's really easy to become a negative tester. One that complains and blocks progress. Be a positive force. Scratch some other people's backs and you'll find yours a lot less itchy."

    "exampleTwo": "Your colleague leaves his computer unlocked for a coffee break. What nasty things could a malicious intruder do in the meantime? ",

    "exampleOne": "Knowing how and when to talk to people can greatly influence the value you bring to your project. Consider learning how your stakeholders prefer to communicate. ",
    "exampleTwo": "A well written and well-founded bug can get fixed more easily rather than having it dismissed as a change or request. ",
    "exampleThree": "Talking to a programmer directly to explain why you find something important can get things done a lot quicker than going through the 'right' procedures."

    "exampleOne": "If the ages between  18 and 45 all result in the same entry price we might test enough if we only try out age 30. ",
    "exampleTwo": "It might be interesting to try only one string in a field that expects only numeric values. Challenge your assumptions about your Equivalence Partitions. ",

    "exampleOne": "Does the increase of the price of an entry ticket at age 45 mean it increases at age 45 or 46? ",
    "exampleTwo": "During calculations, programmers run the risk of confusing \"<\", \">\", \"=\", \"<=\" and \">=\". It's interesting to test around the borders to uncover just which symbol they used. ",
    "exampleThree": "In a Calendar app we could test whether scheduling a meeting from 23:30 to 00:30 is handled and visualized correctly."

    "exampleTwo": "Pairing with a programmer often comes down to learning about each other's mindset and understanding how the other person brings value to the team. ",
    "exampleThree": "A product owner or user will usually test for important, high risk bugs or new features. Learn what's important to them and guide them to it."

    "title": "Pairwise Testing",
    "subTitle": "Techniques",
    "description": "Product level: Test in pairs or more inputs together to find out if the combination gives different results. ",
    "exampleOne": "Combining the number of inputs across variables will greatly increase the number of possible checks. You can do smart combinations of input to minimize this.",
    "exampleTwo": "100 age variables and 10 nationality variables would make for 1000 checks. Sampling for only interesting combinations could bring it down significantly",
    "exampleThree": "When calculating a payment rate dependent on age, gender,... consider listing all influencing factors in an organized list and use them as a basis for a minimal test set."

    "exampleTwo": "Consider automating these checks. What is the absolute minimum this function should do? ",
    "exampleThree": "Unit testing at the lowest level checks pieces of code. A class, for example will have multiple unit tests that verify whether it works as the creator intended."

    "description": "Product level: Testing the interaction between systems, functionalities,... in relation to each other. ",
    "exampleOne": "Components often pass data to each other via interfaces, but do they interpret the same data in a consistent way? Does one component send \"null\" and mean \"empty\" yet the receiving component thinks it's a string?",
    "exampleTwo": "Lots of applications are dependent on other products. Think about logging into a web app through your Facebook account. How would you test communication between them? ",
    "exampleThree": "Big government projects often draw data from other government products. The communication through XML requests can get huge and complex."

    "exampleOne": "A typical user script is to log in, go to item, add item to cart, select address and payment, pay, receive confirmation and logout. ",
    "exampleTwo": "In-app purchases are tricky. You may try to guide the user to them, but don\u2019t want to scare her. Does it work smoothly and in an non-intrusive way? ",

    "exampleTwo": "Mark, one of your older users. He's not tech savvy and needs a lot of training. Bugs found by Mark could be around accessibility, user friendliness and clarity. ",
    "exampleThree": "Personas can be real users, or arch-types, such as \"The power user\" or \"The Kid\". Can you generate random personas with Test Sphere?"

    "description": "Product level: When faced with unlimited possibilities testers select the most likely options the ones most prone to risks. ",
    "exampleOne": "All testing is sampling. We can't run all checks, so we settle for a subset. Being honest about this and keeping this in mind is what keeps us humble. ",
    "exampleTwo": "Choosing which set you will test is very important. Are you mindful of the sampling choices you make? Let's not put too much testing focus on \"ordering foreign books\". ",
    "exampleThree": "Let's test more different variations of ordering English language books, as 99% of our business is in that module."
